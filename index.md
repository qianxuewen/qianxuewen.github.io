## About Me

I am now a Postdoc working on "Communication System Modelling, Analysis and Optimization of Wireless Networks with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces" at the L2S, [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Di Renzo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5dRt0OoAAAAJ&hl=en). From Sep. 2017 to Dec. 2020, I was a Ph.D. student at [CentraleSupelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)/Paris Saclay University, supervised by Marco Di Renzo. I obtained my B.Sc. degree in 2014 and M.Sc. degree in 2017 at [Central South University](http://en.csu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Honggui Deng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Honggui_Deng2).
